## Overview

1. Find DLL files in the injector folder (`*.dll`)
2. Let you pick one or multiple DLLs (auto-pick if only one is found)
3. Find the default target process pattern
4. Inject with retry handling and basic crash/elevation checks

If no matching process is found, the injector can wait/launch (via Steam) and inject after a delay.

## Features

- Console-only UI (clean CLI flow)
- Default target process pattern
- DLL discovery from injector folder (`*.dll`)
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Minimal dependencies (Windows API only, no `vcruntime`)
- Portable (with `/MT`)
- Single or multi-DLL injection
- Retry handling with elevation/crash checks
